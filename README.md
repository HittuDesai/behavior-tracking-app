Webapp that helps schools in assisting teachers create logs of students' behaviour. The app further demos these behaviours as analytics so that schools can help each student individually. This was built in collbaoration with a friend for their PHD thesis.

This is a semi-finshed MVP project, for which there were lots more features planned. However, it was abandoned midway and I no longer intend to maintain this project.
